# Information Disorder Workshop (InDor)


**Co-located with LREC 2026 – Palma de Mallorca, Spain**  
**Palau de Congressos de Palma – 12 May 2026**  
**Half-day workshop**

Online disinformation is a pressing challenge for our societies. Its role in influencing
elections and behaviors has drawn the attention of policy-makers, civil society, and
researchers working to mitigate its negative impact.

The Natural Language Processing (NLP) community is actively contributing to this effort,
with a growing number of datasets and technologies for the automatic recognition of
fake news and related phenomena. However, research in this area still suffers from a
lack of a common theoretical framework, resulting in fragmentation of approaches and
limited cross-fertilization across disciplines.

The **Information Disorder (InDor) Workshop** aims to promote an **interdisciplinary and
intersectoral discussion** towards the development of NLP research on disinformation.

## About Information Disorder

Information Disorder is a framework introduced by **Wardle and Derakhshan (2017)**
to organize theories, definitions, and approaches to the study of disinformation.  
It is built on two main pillars:

1. Acknowledging the need to categorize “fake news” under a **finer-grained taxonomy
   of disorders**:
   - *mis-information*
   - *dis-information*
   - *mal-information*
2. Exploring the role of **contextual factors** that determine the spreading and impact
   of false or misleading information.

## Aims of the InDor Workshop

The InDor workshop aims to:

- Define a **common theoretical ground** for research on disinformation in NLP and beyond  
- Discuss the **cultural and contextual factors** determining susceptibility to disinformation  
- Promote **interdisciplinarity** in the development of datasets and models  
- Discuss the **impact of real-world applications** in contrasting disinformation and
  supporting social good

## Call for Papers

We invite submissions that address Information Disorder from a broad range of
perspectives, with a particular focus on **resources, taxonomies, and benchmarks for
the evaluation of NLP systems**.
