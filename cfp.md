# Call for Papers  
**Information Disorder Workshop (InDor)**  
Co-located with **LREC 2026** – Palma de Mallorca, Spain

Online disinformation is a pressing challenge for our societies. Its role in influencing
elections (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017) and behaviors (van der Linden et al., 2020) has
gathered the attention of different societal actors aimed at mitigating its negative
impact.

The Natural Language Processing (NLP) community is contributing to fighting this
phenomenon with a growing number of datasets (Hussain et al., 2025) and technologies
(e.g. VeraAI, AskVera, Bellingcat) (Lupi et al., 2023; Wuhrl et al., 2023) for the
automatic recognition of fake news. However, this field of research suffers from a
**lack of a common theoretical framework**, which causes a fragmentation of approaches.
The increasing attention of the NLP community to **human-label variation** (Plank, 2022)
raises additional challenges regarding the **cross-cultural and pragmatic implications**
that determine the spreading of disinformation (Dabbous et al., 2022).

The goal of the **Information Disorder (InDor) workshop** is to promote an
**interdisciplinary and intersectoral discussion** towards the development of NLP
research on disinformation.

Information Disorder is a recent framework introduced by **Wardle and Derakhshan (2017)**
to organize theories, definitions, and approaches for the study of disinformation.
The framework is characterized by two main pillars:

1. Acknowledging the need to categorize fake news under a **finer-grained taxonomy of
   disorders** (*mis-information*, *dis-information*, and *mal-information*);
2. Exploring the role of **contextual factors** that determine the spreading of fake
   news and other forms of information disorder.

## Aims of the Workshop

The InDor workshop aims to:

- Define a **common theoretical ground** for research on disinformation in NLP and beyond  
- Discuss the **cultural factors** determining subjectivity and susceptibility
  to disinformation  
- Promote **interdisciplinarity** in the development of datasets and models  
- Discuss the **impact of real-world applications** designed to contrast disinformation

The InDor workshop (half-day duration) will be co-located with the **15th biennial
Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC)**, held at the **Palau de Congressos
de Palma** in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, on **11–16 May 2026**.

## Topics of Interest

We invite original research papers specifically on the following topics, **with a
particular focus on resources, taxonomies, and benchmarks for the evaluation of NLP
systems on Information Disorder**:

- New interdisciplinary theoretical proposals and foundational aspects  
- Surveys on Information Disorder  
- Multiculturality and multilinguality in datasets and technologies  
- Interdisciplinary computational methods and frameworks  
- Community- and user-centered approaches  
- Real-world applications to contrast false information  
- Experimental applications and projects for social good  
- Evaluation of Information Disorder-focused systems  
- Generative approaches to contrast false information  
- Participatory approaches  
- Position papers on Information Disorder  

This list is indicative, not exhaustive. We welcome work from NLP, computational
social science, media studies, communication, psychology, political science, and other
relevant disciplines.

## Submission Types

We accept three types of submissions:

1. **Regular research papers (archival)**  
2. **Non-archival submissions**  
   - Same format as research papers, but they **will not** be included in the LREC
     proceedings  
3. **(Non-archival) research communications**  
   - **1-page abstracts** summarising relevant research published elsewhere

InDor will also accept submissions that have been **rejected from ACL Rolling Review**,
provided they:

- Are accompanied by their reviews, and  
- Fit the topic of the workshop.

---

## Length & Formatting

- **Research papers** (archival or non-archival): **up to 8 pages** of content  
- **Research communications**: **up to 1 page** of content  

The papers should be submitted as a **PDF document**, conforming to the **LREC 2026
formatting guidelines**. Templates and author kits are available at:

👉 <https://lrec2026.info/authors-kit/>

Submissions must be **anonymous** and must conform to the instructions for
**double-blind review**.

---

## Ethical and Resource Requirements

When submitting a paper from the START page, authors will be asked to provide
essential information about **resources in a broad sense**, i.e. not only datasets, but
also technologies, standards, evaluation kits, etc., that:

- Have been used for the work described in the paper, or  
- Are a new result of the research.

ELRA encourages all LREC authors to **share the described language resources**
(data, tools, services, etc.) to enable their reuse and **replicability of experiments**
(including evaluation experiments).

In addition, authors will be required to adhere to **ethical research policies on AI**
and may include an **ethics statement** in their papers.

---

## Review Process

Submissions are open to all and will be **peer-reviewed double-blind**.

- All papers will be refereed by **at least three reviewers**  
- Final acceptance decisions will be made by the **workshop organizers**

Scientific papers will be evaluated based on:

- Relevance to the workshop  
- Significance of the contribution and potential impact  
- Technical quality  
- Scholarship and grounding in prior work  
- Quality of presentation  

---

## Attendance & Presentation

At least **one author of each accepted paper** is required to **participate in the
conference and present the work**, **in-person or online** (in accordance with LREC
policies and workshop arrangements).
